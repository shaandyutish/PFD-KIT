# PFD Kit – Power Supply, Function Generator & Digital Storage Oscilloscope

## 🔌 Overview

The **PFD Kit** is a compact, all‑in‑one **electronics laboratory kit** that combines three essential instruments into a single unit:

* **Regulated DC Power Supply**
* **Function Generator**
* **Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO)**

It is designed mainly for **students, training institutes, and electronics labs**, allowing users to perform experiments, testing, and signal analysis without the need for multiple separate instruments.

---

## 🎯 Why the PFD Kit?

Traditional electronics labs require separate power supplies, signal generators, and oscilloscopes. The PFD Kit simplifies this by:

* Saving **bench space**
* Reducing **setup time**
* Making learning more **hands‑on and beginner‑friendly**

It is ideal for practical sessions, demonstrations, and project testing.

## 📺 Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO)

The built‑in DSO allows real‑time observation of electrical signals.

### 🖥️ TFT Display Information

* Vertical position indicator
* Horizontal position
* Sensitivity (V/div)
* Time base (s/div)
* Trigger level and mode

### 🎛️ Basic Operations

* **[SEL]** – Select parameter to adjust
* **[+] / [–]** – Increase or decrease selected value
* **[OK]** – Freeze or unfreeze waveform (HOLD mode)
* **[CPL] Switch** – Select DC / AC / GND coupling
* **[SEN1] & [SEN2]** – Adjust signal sensitivity
* **[RESET]** – Reboot the oscilloscope

### 📏 0V Line Alignment

If the waveform zero line does not match the VPOS indicator:

1. Set **CPL switch to GND**
2. Select VPOS using **[SEL]**
3. Hold **[OK]** for 2 seconds
4. Release to realign the 0V trace

---

## ⏱️ Trigger Modes

* **Auto Mode** – Continuous refresh, even without triggers
* **Normal Mode** – Refresh only when trigger occurs
* **Single Mode** – Captures a single event and holds the display

These modes help in observing stable or rare signals.

---

## 🔄 Typical Usage Workflow

1. Power the circuit using the **Power Supply**
2. Apply a test signal using the **Function Generator**
3. Observe and measure the signal using the **DSO**
4. Adjust voltage, frequency, or duty cycle as required

---

## 🛠️ Maintenance & Safety

### ⚠️ General Safety

* Always **disconnect circuits before servicing**
* Start with **minimum voltage** settings
* Never short output terminals

### 🔥 Fuse Information

* Fuses protect the system from overload

**Fuse Types:**

* For up to 2A: `FF 2.5A / 600V (6.3 × 32 mm)`
* For up to 5A: `FF 10A / 600V (6.3 × 32 mm)`

⚠️ *Only use specified fuses. Never bypass the fuse holder.*

### 🔍 Fuse Testing

1. Open the top cover
2. Use a Digital Multimeter (DMM)
3. Select **Continuity mode**
4. Check both ends of the fuse
5. Continuity = fuse is OK
